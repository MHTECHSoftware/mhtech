      **MHTech** was founded in Moss, Norway in 2016 by brothers Ole Harald Moe
      and Anders Martin Moe.


      The brothers recognised the connected challenge of global warming and energy waste. Calling on their energy industry design, project delivery and software expertise they developed a platform to analyse and simulate energy systems, enabling optimisation and decarbonisation.


      The business started out modelling electrification of nearshore maritime, before progressing onshore to electrification of public transportation, and onward to the multi-sector decarbonisation solution business offered today.
